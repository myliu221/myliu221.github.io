Research vision
======
Critical infrastructures, including power generation and transmission, communication, and transportation systems, are the mainstay of our societyâ€™s economy, security, and health. On one hand, these infrastructures are vulnerable to natural hazards such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and wildfires. One the other hand, we remain under the dense cloud generated by these infrastructures, which makes the goal of net-zero emissions one of the most defining challenges of the post-industrial era. My research aims to enhance resilience of critical infrastructures and make renewable energy more accessible and affordable to people. There are several specific directions for my work, which lie in collecting detailed asset data using machine learning approaches, developing hazard maps for life-cycle analysis of infrastructures, developing design methods for infrastructures in a system level using time-variant reliability and system reliability techniques, and conducting resilience analysis of interdependent infrastructure systems.
